# EPO-2 Smart Robot Challenge (SRC)

In this project, there are C-related files and VHDL-related files.
Please keep them in the designated folders.
Also, please do not commit any file that Questa Sim generates, for example .mpf, .mti, .wlf files.
So only .c and .h files in the c folder,
and only .vhdl files in the vhdl folder.

## Questa Sim

When creating a project in Questa Sim, please add .vhdl files to the project by referencing them from the location
of your local git repository. So do not create your Questa Sim project in the same location as your git folder!
